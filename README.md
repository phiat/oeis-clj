# oeis-clj

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

**NEEDS SOME LOVE (only returns single digits instead of '11' or '123')**

## Usage

*originally intended for repl work, retrofitting for a more useable library*

```clojure
user=> (use 'oeis-clj.core)
nil
user=> (take 7 (parse-oeis-page "A000045"))           ;; return first 7 numbers in fibonacci
(0 1 1 2 3 5 8)
```
